Hi, I'm Rania ðŸ‘‹ I'm a career changer based in the SF Bay Area and have a passion for the ML/DL space.

I'm currently working towards a dual AS degree in Computer Information Systems and Math at Mission College, with a completion date by Spring 2025. My intention is to pursue a master's degree in Computer Science, with a specialization in machine learning.

My interests are in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. With my academic background in the humanities, I aim to adopt a multidisciplinary approach in my work, employing my skills in textual analysis, philosophy, and research methodologies.

I'm actively seeking internship opportunities in CS. Feel free to reach out or provide feedback -- I love to meet and collaborate with others!
